            <p> This is not the first language a beginner should learn. its too complex. Python, PHP are easier to pick up  </p>
            <p> C++ is very slow to write in. from a business point of view, its cheaper to write in a modern language like Python</p>
            <p> there are plenty of jobs in C++, although they are task specific. </p>
